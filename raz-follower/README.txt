raz-followor directory

these are the files from when this repo was called raz-follower overall, a school side-project where I tried to make a line follower out of my raspberry pi 3.  I see now that my problem was probably that I was trying to control a 5V quad half H-bridge motor controller with the Pi's 3V3 GPIO pins.  Live and learn.
Now I have a Raspberry Pi 4, I'm a little smarter in general, and I'm ready to write more general code.
Still for the Raspberry Pi.  Still in C/C++.  So I decided to keep these files here instead of making a new repo.
